# Homemade MP3 Player
A homemade mp3 player written in Python using tkinter and the pygame tools that interacts with a playlist of mp3 files.

## Technologies
This project uses Python v. 3.9.6 and uses tkinter and pygame to build the widgets and provide actions to the widget 
buttons.

## Using the MP3 Player
To run the mp3 player, run the main.py python file to start the mp3 player application. When the application opens it 
will display the following buttons:
1. Play
2. Stop
3. Pause
4. Unpause
Click in the black space under the buttons to display the list of songs. You can select a song in the list and play it 
by clicking the button. Once the song is playing, you can stop it entirely or pause the song. To resume playing the song, 
click 'Unpause'.
